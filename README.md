# Hangman Application

Implementation of a mobile 'hangman' game application.

Created during the course *Native App Studio* (week 2) at the *University of Amsterdam*.

Works best for in API level 16 or higher because of the font choise (the fontFamily attribute is used).
### Version
1.0

#### Improvements
Some elements that could still be improved are:
- update hangman images (current version bit blurry)
- make links in acknowledgements work
- use bundle to avoid reinitializing of game after screen rotation
